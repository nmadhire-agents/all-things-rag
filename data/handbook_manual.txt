# Z-Tech Global Work Handbook

## Remote Work
Z-Tech encourages remote work from home, co-working spaces, or temporary domestic locations.
Employees must stay reachable during assigned timezone hours and use approved managed devices.
Public Wi-Fi usage is allowed only with corporate VPN enabled.

## International Work
Working from another country is capped at 14 days in a rolling 12-month period without permit support.
Beyond 14 days, employees must open a Global Mobility case and obtain HR, Legal, and Payroll approval.
Violations can trigger immigration, payroll, and tax exposure.

## International Tax
Employees traveling internationally may need Form A-12 before departure when cross-border work exceeds 7 business days.
The tax team uses Form A-12 to assess treaty relief, withholding obligations, and permanent establishment risk.

## Travel Approval
International travel requests must be submitted at least 14 days before departure in the travel portal.
Manager approval is mandatory, and finance approval is required for total costs above 2,000 USD equivalent.

## Security

Lost or stolen devices must be reported within one hour to security operations.
