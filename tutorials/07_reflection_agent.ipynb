    "## Why Does a Single-Pass Answer Need a Critic?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tutorial 6, the ReAct agent calls the retriever and generates an answer in\n",
    "one pass. The agent does not check whether its own answer is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: Confident Wrong Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models can produce answers that sound convincing but are factually wrong\n",
    "or incomplete. Common failure modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Failure Mode | Example |\n",
    "|--------------|--------|\n",
    "| Hallucination | States 'employees get 30 days' when context says 25 |\n",
    "| Missing citation | Answers without saying which policy section it came from |\n",
    "| Vague answer | Says 'some days are allowed' instead of '14 days maximum' |\n",
    "| Ignored condition | Omits 'beyond 14 days requires Global Mobility approval' |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: A Separate Critic Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The Critic is a second LLM call with a different system prompt. It reads:\n",
    "- The original question\n",
    "- The retrieved context\n",
    "- The Worker's draft answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The Critic checks whether the answer is accurate, complete, and grounded in the\n",
    "context. If not, it returns structured feedback: exactly what is wrong and what\n",
    "the Worker should fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Two Separate Agents Rather Than One?\n",
    "\n",
    "A single agent asked to 'critique your own answer' tends to agree with itself.\n",
    "Using a separate Critic call with a different system prompt (focused entirely on\n",
    "finding problems) produces more reliable error detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Worker system prompt  : 'Answer the question using only the provided context.'\n",
    "Critic system prompt  : 'Find errors, missing information, and unsupported claims.'\n",
    "```\n"

    "## How the Reflection Loop Works (Round by Round)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Round 1:\n",
    "  Worker receives: question + context\n",
    "  Worker produces: draft answer v1\n",
    "  Critic receives: question + context + draft answer v1\n",
    "  Critic produces: {approved: false, feedback: 'Missing the 14-day limit.'}\n",

    "  Critic receives: question + context + draft answer v2\n",
    "  Critic produces: {approved: true, feedback: ''}\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: draft answer v2 is returned as the final answer.\n",

    "  unsupported claims) and produces actionable feedback.\n",
    "- The Worker incorporates feedback and produces an improved answer in the next\n",
