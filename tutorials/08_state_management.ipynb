    "## Why Does an Agent Need State Management?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Stateless Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tutorials 6 and 7, the agent loop runs from start to finish without saving\n",
    "any intermediate snapshots. This works for short tasks but creates problems for\n",
    "real-world systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Problem | What Can Go Wrong |\n",
    "|---------|------------------|\n",
    "| Long task interrupted | Network error at step 7 of 10 means starting over |\n",
    "| Wrong tool call | Agent calls the wrong tool; no way to rewind without re-running everything |\n",
    "| Audit requirement | Cannot show a regulator what the agent did step by step |\n",
    "| Human approval needed | Cannot pause at a sensitive step and wait for a human to approve |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "A **checkpoint** is a labelled snapshot of the agent's complete state at a\n",
    "specific point in time. Think of it like a save point in a video game:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Game without saves  : if you lose, you restart from the beginning\n",
    "Game with saves     : if you lose, you reload from the last save point\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent without CPs   : if step 7 fails, you re-run all 10 steps\n",
    "Agent with CPs      : if step 7 fails, you rewind to checkpoint at step 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is Time Travel?\n",
    "\n",
    "'Time travel' means rewinding the agent state to any saved checkpoint and\n",
    "resuming from there. You can:\n",
    "- Inspect what the agent knew at any past step\n",
    "- Re-run a failed step with different parameters\n",
    "- Replay from a checkpoint to test a different code path\n"

    "\n",
    "- Checkpoints let you inspect exactly what the agent knew at any past step:\n",
    "  what context it had, what tools it called, and what answers it considered.\n",
    "- Time travel restores a full agent state from any checkpoint, enabling\n",
    "  retry, audit, and debugging workflows.\n",
    "- Human-in-the-loop review is possible by pausing at any step and resuming\n",
    "  or rewinding based on human feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Does Not Work Well\n",
    "\n",
    "- This tutorial's StateManager stores checkpoints in memory. A production\n",
    "  system needs persistent storage (database, file system) so checkpoints\n",
    "  survive process restarts.\n",
    "- Checkpointing adds overhead if saved very frequently in a tight loop.\n",
    "  In practice, save checkpoints at meaningful boundaries (before a tool call,\n",
    "  after a human decision) rather than every single computation.\n",

    "- **Tutorial 6** showed how to wrap RAG retrieval as an agent tool.\n",
    "- **Tutorial 7** showed how a Critic improves answer quality.\n",

    "\n",
