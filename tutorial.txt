## Tutorial flow (implemented)

The runnable versions of these parts are in:
- `tutorials/01_basic_rag.ipynb`
- `tutorials/02_semantic_chunking.ipynb`
- `tutorials/03_reranking.ipynb`
- `tutorials/04_hybrid_search.ipynb`

Each notebook has:
- novice-friendly embedding and retrieval walkthroughs
- score tables (`top-k`, similarity, and ranking changes)
- diagrams for pipeline understanding

## Part 1: Basic RAG (Dense Retrieval Baseline)

**What changes:** nothing yet, this is the baseline.

**What you learn explicitly:**
1. How text becomes embedding vectors
2. How similarity scoring ranks chunks
3. Why nearest-neighbor retrieval can miss critical policy exceptions

**Example failure:**
"What is the policy for working from another country?" can over-retrieve generic remote-work chunks instead of the international policy chunk.

---

## Part 2: Semantic Chunking

**What changes:** chunking strategy only (`fixed` → `semantic`).

**What you learn explicitly:**
1. Why chunk boundaries matter
2. How better chunk cohesion improves retrieval relevance
3. How to compare against Part 1 with the same query set

**Expected gain:** improved retrieval for questions where rules and exceptions must remain together.

---

## Part 3: Reranking

**What changes:** add second-stage reranking after dense retrieval.

**What you learn explicitly:**
1. First-stage candidate generation vs second-stage precision ranking
2. Before/after rank movement tables
3. Quality-latency tradeoff from reranking

**Expected gain:** better top-ranked context when initial vector search is fuzzy.

---

## Part 4: Hybrid Search

**What changes:** combine dense retrieval with BM25 keyword retrieval using rank fusion.

**What you learn explicitly:**
1. Why exact token matching matters (e.g., `Form A-12`)
2. How dense and keyword retrieval complement each other
3. How fusion improves robustness on exact-term + semantic queries

**Expected gain:** better handling of both precise identifiers and conceptual policy questions.
